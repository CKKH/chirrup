## Create a messaging app

#### Objectives
- Use a problem solving approach to implement user requirements
- Build a web app

### Stage 1 - requirements satisfied
- User sees the home page at the index where it has
    - A heading
    - A form
    - All the messages with a timestamp in reverse chronological order(newest at the top)
- User can input message as text
- User can submit the form and see the new message at the top of the previous messages

### How to run the app from your terminal

```
git clone git@github.com:CKKH/chirrup.git
cd chirrup
bundle install
rackup

```
- visit local host at the stated port and message away!

#### Keys to success
- Follow [BDD](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/bdd_cycle.md)
- Focus on [pairing well and getting better at communicating](https://tuple.app/pair-programming-guide)
- Reflect on your learning and problem-solving process - and actively seek to improve them
- Keep tasks **as simple as possible*

#### Planning -
- User stories
- Diagram what itâ€™s going to look like
    - What pages - rough sketches
- Diagram some typical requests and responses - the flow of data through your app
- Some first tests
